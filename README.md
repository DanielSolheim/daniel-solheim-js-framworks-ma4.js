# Javascript Framworks MA 4


## This is a school task made with React

#Level 2 can be found "src/component/recipe/IngredientList.js"
##And is outputted as a list on each item
#SearchRecipe.js === Search.js

## I know that each item is supposed to have a key. So you will see that error in the console
# did not know what to use as a key in this instance, since there was no id in the list
# should i just generate a key myself?  

## I do not know what is supposed to be in this file exactly, or the syntax, will read up on that.
# to late now.
